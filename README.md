This is part of a master project in Automated Essay Scoring at the Department of Theoretical Physics at Lund University. This repository contains a multilayers perceptron that uses the ASAP dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes) in order to predict the grades of human written essays. The model is based on predetermined features extracted from the essays, such as average word length.

The "test.py" file contains a main function that will create an mlp using the first essay set in the data (up to 1783 essays).
